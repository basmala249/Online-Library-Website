        <p style="padding-top: 50;">In A Brief History of Time, Hawking writes in non-technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the Universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics. He talks about basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the Universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity)
        </p>
        <p>He discusses two major theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the Universe.
        <br> Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the Universe in a coherent manner.
         <br>He discusses the history of astronomical studies, particularly ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's conclusions about spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the Universe, later elaborated upon by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top: 50;">Hawking then depicts the rejection of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic model and the gradual development of the currently accepted heliocentric model of the Solar System. Hawking also covers how the topic of the origin of the Universe and time was studied and debated over the centuries</p>
