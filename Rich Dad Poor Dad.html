        <p style="padding-top: 50;">Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his "rich dad" — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing.
             The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.
