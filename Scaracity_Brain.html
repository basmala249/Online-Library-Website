            In Scarcity Brain (2023), science writer Michael Easter explores human behaviors that stem from feelings of scarcity. Many aspects of modern life, from slot machines to social media and the food industry, exploit our scarcity brain. However, todayâ€™s humans also have the ability to counter these cravings. Easter offers tactics to help us move towards an abundance mindset and foster healthy habits for meaningful living.

            Michael Easter traveled to Iraq to investigate the rise of a new street drug called Captagon. He was interested in understanding human behavior, particularly the behaviors that harm us most. These harmful behaviors often stem from feelings of scarcity and are usually reactions to scarcity cues. This scarcity mindset is an ancient behavior system that helped our ancestors survive but is now exploited by corporations in our modern world of abundance. This leads to addiction, obesity, anxiety, chronic diseases, and more. Easter aimed to understand this scarcity brain and find solutions for it.            <h3>Learn :</h3>
