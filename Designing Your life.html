        <h2><b>Overview:</b></h2>
        <p >In Designing Your New Work Life, Burnett and Evans show us how design thinking can transform our present job, and how it can improve our experience of work in times of disruption. All disruption is personal, write Burnett and Evans, as with the life-altering global pandemic we are living through now. 
            Designing Your New Work Life makes clear that disruption is the new normal, that it is here to stay and that it is accelerating. And in the book's new chapters, Burnett and Evans show us step by step, how to design our way through disruption and how to stay ahead of it—and thrive.

            In this book, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans show us how design thinking can help us create a life that is both meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of who or where we are, what we do or have done for a living, or how young or old we are. 
            The same design thinking responsible for amazing technology, products, and spaces can be used to design and build your career and your life, a life of fulfillment and joy, constantly creative and productive, one that always holds the possibility of surprise.
