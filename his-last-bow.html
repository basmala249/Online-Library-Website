            <h2><b>Overview:</b></h2>
     
            <p>His Last Bow is the final book written by Arthur Conan Doyle starring the infamous Sherlock Holmes. It follows Holmes when he comes back from the dead after The Reichenbach Falls event. He decides he isn't actually retiring but this book really is the end.

                <p>In truth, I find it difficult to review this book. It is already so well known and Holmes is almost a part of British culture. If I were to say anything bad about it I highly doubt that anybody would believe me. Not that I would wish to say anything bad about it anyway.</p>
                <p>Not all the stories are in order, the last merely being the definite last. And what a fine finish it is, Holmes finally having the ending he deserves, set when Britain is on the brink of war. There are some brilliant stories in this book, my favourite probably being one where Holmes is supposedly having a break on the coast. A horrific death is discovered, with few clues left. Of course Holmes can't keep himself away and the case is solved in days, in that way which makes Holmes so incredible both as a detective and as a character.</p>
                <p>Conan Doyle must have had a truly brilliant mind to create mysteries which at first seem so impossible both to commit or to solve. I would rate the stories 9/10, and apologise for such a short review but I can find nothing to find fault with.</p>
